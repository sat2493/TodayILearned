# Framework Choice

TIL that there are multiple factors that can help decide on whether to choose between frameworks like Flutter, React Native, or Ionic.

Those components are framework complexity, cross-platform capability, and configuration advantages

Ionic seems to have the simplest learning curve since you actually don't even need  a framework to write a working application. Meanwhile Flutter has both the Flutter and Dart frameworks and React Native has the JavaScript and React.js frameworks.
