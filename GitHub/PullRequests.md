# Pull Requests

```
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
```

Having been used to working in projects with no more than 3 people, I've never found myself the time to find when it would be useful to give pull requests vs. simply commiting. 

```
From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35007939/what-is-the-difference-between-commits-and-pull-requests 
A pull request is a way to 'commit' to a repository in which you don't have writing permissions. The maintainers of that repository will check your request and decide if they either want to merge it with your code or leave the original as it is.
```

Apparently, I have yet to contribute to an open-source project as a non-owner.
