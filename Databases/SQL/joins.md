# Joins

TIL there are four types of joins.

An inner join is basically like an intersection used in sets from math. It always returns data where two or more tables have the same "thing". The "thing" is some condition you set.

A left join keeps all of the data from the left table and merges it with any data from the right that matches the "thing's" criteria.

A right join is a vice versa of a left join.

An outer join simply combines all data from the left and right tables. However, if no matches exists between tables, then it places "NULL" onto a spot.
