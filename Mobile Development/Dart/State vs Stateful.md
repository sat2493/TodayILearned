# State vs. Stateful

States often take external input and have a corresponding output for them. This output is the way the data gets displayed onto a screen.

The difference between Stateless and Stateful is that Stateful widgets allow external inputs to change the internal data of the state.

Meanwhile Stateless widgets only allow the data to re-render the widget. Stateless widgets don't have internal data.
