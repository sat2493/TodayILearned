# Adding Underscores to Class Names

The purpose of adding underscores to class names is so that classes wouldn't be used outside of the files in which they are defined. This is a good programming practice for files that are accessed and modified by teams of over 50 people. You wouldn't want someone else being able to access or manipulate a class you defined outside of the purpose for which it was to be used.
