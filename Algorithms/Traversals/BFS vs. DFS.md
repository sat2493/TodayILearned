# Tradeoffs between BFS and DFS

TIL that there are tradeoffs between implementing either BFS or DFS.

DFS tends to be easier to implement through simple recursive principles. Meanwhile breadth first search is most effective only when using data structures such as queues. Thus, BFS can be used to find the shortest path using queues. Meanwhile DFS is best for traversing adjacent neighbors and their contents very deeply before exploring the next option.
